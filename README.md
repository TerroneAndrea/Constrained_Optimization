# Constrained_Optimization
The aim of this project is to solve a constrained optimization problem by applying the **Penalty Method**.

I didn't use any pre-built optimization method. I only used autograd for calculating the gradient of the function to minimize and autograd.numpy for vectors and matrix operations.
